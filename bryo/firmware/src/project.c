/* Projects: four slots. The slots live in .noinit RAM: they
 * survive resets and UBOOT entry. With FELUCCA_FLASH (default) every save
 * also goes to flash through storage.c, and an
 * empty RAM slot is filled from flash on load.
 *
 * Format 7 ("FUN7", written) stores P_COUNT (byte 66) and maps an older count as user presets do: FUN7 of
 * 89 parameters (before the chord keys P_CHRD / P_VOIC) loads its engine values at today's P_E0..P_E7,
 * the chord keys OFF / CLOSE, and its motion events' ids from its P_E0 on move up with them (proj_motion_ids).
 * 68 + 4 x (91 + 2 + 64 x 9) + chain + motion = 3040 of the 3372 bytes before the name: 332 spare, room for
 * 83 more track parameters (4 bytes each).
 * Format 6 ("FUN6") adds a 36-byte song chain before the checksum.
 * Format 5 ("FUN5", read only) = format 4 with the drum grid: a step is 10 bytes (step_t: its lane hits and
 * their accents after the 8 bytes it was), and each track has 40 reserved bytes (lane[8][5], written 0: room
 * for per-lane sounds of the DRUM engine). 4 ("FUN4": PROJ_NP_V4 parameters, the modulation matrix), 3
 * ("FUN3": PROJ_NP_V3, the SLICER), 2 ("FUN2") and 1 ("FUN1": PROJ_NP_V2) are read and converted, mapped by
 * count as user presets are (the first np - 8 are P_LEVEL.. in order, the last 8 P_E0..P_E7; the
 * parameters added since take their defaults: the SLICER OFF, every matrix slot OFF). Their steps get no
 * hits; on a DRUM track their notes that are a lane's note become its hits (proj_grid: the same notes and
 * velocities play, the grid shows them as its own).
 * Their engine bytes are kept: formats 1 and 2 had engines 0..7 (ANALOG .. WHEEL), and the engines
 * added since (SLICE 8, ..) were appended, no index moved.
 *
 * Track 4 was the GM drum part until 1.0 (no engine: its byte 0; its level and reverb send in the
 * globals G_DRLVL / G_DRREV, which are inert now). A project says which it has in `parts`: NPART
 * when written since, 0 before (a reserved byte, always written 0: the format and its size did not
 * change). proj_drums_to_part turns such a track 4 into a DRUM part with its default kit (the GM map, so
 * its drum steps still play drums; until 1.0.2 it was the SAMPLE engine's PERC set), keeping its steps, its
 * pattern and mix parameters (LEN DIV SWING GATE, PAN MUTE), its SLICER, and the drum level and reverb send
 * as LEVEL and REV.
 *
 * The byte `phys` (reserved, always 0, before 1.0) says what a PHYS track's MODEL means: 0 MODEL 2 was
 * DUST (dropped: it loads as MODAL bowed, eng_phys.c phys_legacy); 1 MODEL 4 was DRUM (the kit is the DRUM
 * engine since: such a track loads as DRUM, core.h drum_from_phys); 2 (PROJ_PHYS) as today. proj_phys.
 *
 * Format 8 ("FUN8", written since 1.0) = FUN7 with each track's FM6 patch (eng_fm6.c, the 128-byte packed
 * record, 4 x 128 bytes just before the name): a project is self-contained. On load an FM6 track's SLOT shows F n
 * when its patch is that factory one, else OWN (eng_fm6.c fm6_adopt; a stored 8..34, the B slots of the patch bank
 * before 1.0.3, is OWN too: the project has the patch).
 * It is 3584 bytes (FUN7: 3388); FUN7 is read (its tracks get the init patch). The retained cache (proj_slot,
 * .noinit) grew with it: after an update its slot 1 still starts with a FUN7 record, which is read; the other
 * slots fail their hash and come back from flash (persist_boot).
 *
 * DIGITAL (engine 1) was retired in 1.0 (fm4_convert.c): a track of it, in any format, loads as FM6 with the
 * patch converted from its values as the track's own (proj_fm4, on every import; the stored record keeps what it
 * holds until saved again). Its motion events on the EDIT or OP ENV values are dropped.
 *
 * SAMPLE's SET 4, PERC (the GM drum kit), was retired after 1.0.2: a SAMPLE track that selects it, in any
 * format, loads as the DRUM engine with its default kit (core.h drum_from_perc: the same GM key map, its steps
 * as they are, the rest of its sound kept; proj_perc, on every import as proj_fm4). Its motion events on the
 * EDIT values are dropped (SAMPLE's meanings, not DRUM's).
 *
 * Built on the Mac too (tests/project_test.c, -DPROJ_HOST): the part above the #ifndef
 * PROJ_HOST needs core.h, params.c (TP) and engines.c. */
