# Host tests of the Felucca sources (no hardware). Run from the repo root after ./build.sh:
#   tests/run_tests.sh
#
# Regression suite (tests/regress.c, tests/target_budget.py; details at the top of regress.c):
#   golden renders  every engine x preset, the GM map on DRUM, voice modes, FX sends, a 4-track mix: one hash
#                   each in tests/golden.txt. A change of the sound fails with the list of renders.
#   health          clipping, DC, peak level, voices free after the release, silence at the end.
#   CPU             instructions / sample per preset and mix (tests/cpu_baseline.txt, +25 %), ns printed;
#                   target: loop instructions of the render functions in the pi32v2 disassembly
#                   (tests/target_budget.txt, +10 %; exact, static).
#   voices          the budget of 8, steal fades, MONO / LEGATO / UNISON keep their note, the VOICE cap,
#                   no hanging notes on any MIDI / key routing.
# UI renders (tests/ui_render.c): every screen in every palette from the real drawing code: the layout lint (no text
#                   off the screen, cut, hidden, overlapping or spilling out of its cell / card; only free text
#                   ellipsised), GREY gray, MONO neutral, the draw cost, the text audit (build/ui_new/text_audit.tsv);
#                   PNGs of GREY MONO GREEN PAPER NIGHT in build/ui_new (tests/ui_render.py), the findings in build/ui_new/report.txt;
#                   FM6's 32 algorithm charts as drawn (no box overlapping, no route through a box or crossing another);
#                   DIGITAL's screens (its algorithm charts, OP ENV) with FELUCCA_FM4=1 too (build/ui_fm4: lint, GREY, MONO);
#                   every frame of the rolling digits (lint, GREY, MONO), their filmstrips in build/ui_slot;
#                   the alignment: every text / icon / keycap meant to be centred, or on its neighbours' line, by its
#                   ink against its box (cells, chips, buttons, rows, knobs, the roll's strip, the keycaps' pills), every
#                   screen in FLAT and LINE and every palette, over every value it can show; 1 px off or more fails
#                   (build/ui_new/align.txt). MENU > LARGE: every screen again (FLAT, LINE, every palette) and the page / value
#                   sweep with the tall cards, the same lint and alignment; sheet_LARGE_GREY.png, sheet_LARGE_MONO.png.
# UI (tests/ui_test.c): the UI sources against stub display / buttons / knobs: sound loads keep the steps and
#                   the track's ARP / SCL / SLICER, the SEQ > PATTERNS loader and its REPLACE? dialog, the
#                   one-step undo of both (SAVE held), REC on TRACKS / SEQ / ARP, STEP and ARP while recording,
#                   MIDI IN ROUT, saves refused while playing and the OVERWRITE? dialog, MUTE on TRACKS KNOB 1,
#                   the DRUM grid (keys, knobs, LEDs, pages, live recording into it, BEAT from PATTERNS).
# Audio / persistence / editor: the real C paths against simulated DMA and NOR flash: bounded overload
#                   fades, shared-voice limits, deferred settings and retries, failed-save rollback,
#                   malformed transfers, transport-stop timeouts, MIDI and UART recovery.
# CHORD (tests/chord_test.c): the chord keys (src/chord.c): diatonic triads / sevenths of several scales and roots,
#                   the fixed shapes and voicings (at most 4 notes), names, MONO plays the root, a release ends
#                   exactly what its key / MIDI note started, recording, the ARP, MIDI IN, kits ignore CHRD.
# MOD (tests/mod_test.c): the modulation matrix: slots that do nothing are bit-identical, every source on each
#                   kind of destination, clamping, MIDI CC1 / CC11 / aftertouch routing, the cost of 4 active
#                   slots (at most +5 %), demos in build/mod_demo/.
# PERFORM (tests/perform_test.c): the FX hold layer (src/perform.c): 1/16 starts, stereo buffer effects, the
#                   too-long REPEAT, the SLICER interplay, silent layer keys, idle bit-identical, cost; build/perform_demo/;
#                   OCT UP / DN (the harmonizer): pitch, stereo, clicks, the shimmer bounded, cost; build/fx_demo/.
# REVERB (tests/reverb_test.c): REVERB TYPE (src/fx.c): ROOM bit for bit as before, SPRING's decay against SIZE,
#                   its chirp (group delay rising with frequency), stability at the corners, level, a model change
#                   without a click, its cost against ROOM (+30 % at most); demos in build/fx_demo/.
# SLICE (tests/slice_test.c): slice tables, AUTO onsets of a user-slot loop, reverse, keys, modes, the MAN slices
#                   (SLICES page) and their store in the slot (src/slice_store.c); the presets and the loop;
#                   demos in build/slice_demo/.
# INPUT (tests/input_test.c): the key / button debounce of hal/fm1_input.h against the TIMER5 scan and bouncing
#                   contacts: a press within 2 scans (<= 2.3 ms), one note per bouncy press, no early or hanging
#                   release, stray samples ignored, fast repeats, the encoders' detents; the LED scan: lit LEDs every
#                   frame, dim ones a short pulse (the second line write) every frame, each only on its own column.
# USB audio (tests/uac_test.c): the UAC1 descriptors as a host parses them (with and without CDC), the
#                   ring and packetiser: 44.1 frames per packet, every frame in order, underrun / overrun, restart.
# web (web/test_web.mjs): the editor protocol against its mock device, whose tables must equal the
#                   firmware's (tests/descdump.c -> build/host/desc.json), the package builder, the updater.
# PHYS (tests/phys_test.c): stability over the whole parameter and pitch range, the worst-case cost against
#                   the heaviest factory preset, demos in build/phys_demo/; tests/phys_ref.cpp compares the
#                   fixed-point models with DaisySP's float originals when DaisySP is there (DAISYSP=path).
# DRUM (tests/drum_test.c): the drum voices (src/drum_voice.c): pitch, decay, centroid and level against
#                   Felucca's targets, the controls' directions, no clipping, DC, retriggers, the hat choke, the
#                   kick on a small speaker; the DRUM engine (src/eng_drum.c): its key map, the 8 lanes together,
#                   one hit per lane, the choke between lanes; the cost per voice; demos in build/drum_demo/.
# NOISE (tests/noise_test.c): the engine (src/eng_noise.c): COLR's slope (white, pink, brown), the filter and the
#                   register clock following the key, META periodic at the key, no DC, no clipping at the
#                   corners, a note from silence the same twice, the cost per voice; demos in build/noise_demo/.
# DIGITAL -> FM6 (tests/fm4_test.c, built with FELUCCA_FM4=1): the retired four-operator engine against its conversion
#                   (src/fm4_convert.c): routes and carriers per algorithm, the presets' PTCH, and the sound (pitch,
#                   centroid, RMS envelope) of its presets and algorithms; demos in build/fm4_demo/. tests/digital_test.c
#                   (FELUCCA_FM4=1 too): DIGITAL's operator envelopes. Default builds have no DIGITAL (engine 1 reserved).
# FM6 (tests/fm6_test.c): the 6-operator FM engine (src/eng_fm6.c, src/fm6_core.c): the 32 algorithms' carriers, the
#                   operator envelopes (stages, rates, the voice ending), bit-stable notes, a click-free retrigger, no DC /
#                   clipping over the factory patches, the macros' directions, PTCH, pack / unpack and the SysEx
#                   layouts, the 6-voice cap, the cost per voice; demos in build/fm6_demo/.
# Change baseline entries only for reviewed, intentional differences in sound or cost;
# retain every unaffected golden / CPU / target entry. VERBOSE=1: every render.
