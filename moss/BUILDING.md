# Building Felucca

The build makes three files in `build/`:

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `felucca.bin` | the firmware app |
| `loader/ota.bin` | the update loader |
| `felucca.fwsc` | the installable package (app + loader) |

## Prerequisites (macOS)

- Python 3 with Pillow and fontTools: `pip3 install Pillow fonttools` (the UI font and icons are
  rasterised at build time)
- Docker Desktop. The JieLi toolchain is Linux x86-64 only; the build runs each tool in a
  `linux/amd64` `debian:bookworm-slim` container (Rosetta on Apple silicon). Keep the source
  tree in a folder Docker can share, e.g. under `/Users`.
- The JieLi Linux toolchain (clang 4.0.1 for pi32v2, from JieLi's package server):

  ```
  tools/get_toolchain.sh            # installs to ~/.jieli/toolchain
  ```

- The JieLi AC79 SDK (Apache-2.0). The package uses three of its files
  (`cpu/wl82/tools/uboot.boot`, `cfg_tool.bin`, `cfg/eq_cfg_hw.bin`); they are not part of this tree.

  ```
  git clone --depth 1 --branch AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13 \
      https://gitee.com/Jieli-Tech/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK.git ~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK
  ```

- Node.js (optional, for the web tests).

On Linux x86-64 the toolchain runs natively and Docker is not needed.

## Build

```
./build.sh
```

`JIELI_TOOLCHAIN` and `AC79_SDK` override the default locations
(`~/.jieli/toolchain`, `~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK`).

`./build.sh --release 1.0` makes a release build: the package identity becomes `FM-1_910`
and the version string `v1.0`; the package is `build/felucca-1.0.fwsc`, and
`build/release-1.0/` holds what a release ships: the package, the app
(`felucca-1.0-app.bin`), `SHA256SUMS`, the sample attribution, `LICENSE`, `LICENSING.md` and
`LICENSES/` (the package contains Apache-2.0 SDK files, so the licence texts travel with it).

Build options (environment, `0` or `1`; defaults in `firmware/src/felucca.c`, `core.h` and `icons.c`):

| Flag | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FELUCCA_FLASH` | 1 | settings, presets and projects in flash |
| `FELUCCA_OTA` | 1 | update entry (needs `FELUCCA_FLASH`) |
| `FELUCCA_CDC` | 1 | USB serial console |
| `FELUCCA_CDC_DEFAULT` | 1 | `0`: the console is built in but left out of USB from boot (as MENU > USB SERIAL OFF) |
| `FELUCCA_UAC` | 1 | USB audio input (the master output, 44.1 kHz stereo) |
| `FELUCCA_UART` | 1 | TRS MIDI IN |
| `FELUCCA_SLICE` | 1 | the SLICE engine |
| `FELUCCA_ICONS` | 1 | parameter icons on the knob cards |
| `FELUCCA_FM4` | 0 | the retired DIGITAL engine (4-operator FM) instead of its FM6 conversion |

`FELUCCA_USB_LAYOUT` (`0` to `3`, default `0`) picks other USB descriptor layouts for testing; see
`firmware/src/usb.c`.

## Samples

The CC0 instrument samples that the SAMPLE engine uses are in `assets/samples-cc0/`
(Versilian Studios, see `ATTRIBUTION.txt` there). `tools/fetch_cc0.py` downloads them
again from the source repositories. Without that folder the build still works, with no
instrument sets in the SAMPLE engine.

## Tests

```
tests/run_tests.sh
```

Runs the host tests and, with Node.js, the web page tests. Run it after `./build.sh`
(it uses `build/` and needs `AC79_SDK` set as for the build). The suites cover flash storage,
user presets, projects of every format, backup, the keys and knobs, MIDI (USB, TRS, clock,
control), USB audio, the update entry and loader, the command-line installer, the UI (the real
drawing code against stubs: every screen in every palette is rendered and checked for clipped or
overlapping text; PNGs land in `build/ui_new/`), every engine (DRUM, NOISE, PHYS, FM6, SLICE, the
DIGITAL conversion), the chord keys, the modulation matrix, the FX layer, the reverbs, the SLICER
and swing. With `DAISYSP` pointing at a DaisySP checkout, the PHYS models are also compared with
their floating-point originals; without it that test is skipped.

The regression suite (`tests/regress.c`) renders every engine and preset and compares a
hash of each render with `tests/golden.txt`; it also checks levels, voices and the CPU
cost (`tests/cpu_baseline.txt`, `tests/target_budget.txt`). After an intended change of
the sound, `GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 sh tests/run_tests.sh` rewrites the hashes; `BUDGET_UPDATE=1`
does the same for the cost files.

## Install

Use the web installer in Chrome or Edge:
<https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/webapp/installer/>. It installs the released package.

From the command line (needs `pip3 install mido python-rtmidi`):

```
python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/felucca.fwsc
python3 tools/fm1_install.py --info          # identity of the connected FM-1
```

Or, to install your own build from the web installer, make a local copy of the site and open it from `localhost`
(Web MIDI needs a secure context):

```
python3 web/make_site.py build/felucca.fwsc dev /tmp/felucca-site
cd /tmp/felucca-site && python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/webapp/installer/
```

Installing firmware is at your own risk. If an install fails and the FM-1 no longer
starts, recovery needs [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter).
