## Features

- **Thirteen engines** (below), each with its own factory presets
- **Four tracks**, one synth part each with its own engine and sound (drums are the DRUM engine);
  8 voices shared between them. ALGORITHM selects the track on every page
- **Sequencer:** 64 steps per track with chords, ties, accent, slide and per-step chance; a piano
  roll of the steps; a drum grid (white keys = steps, black keys = lanes); motion recording of knob
  moves (a motion icon marks the cards it drives); live loop recording with overdub; divisions listed
  by length, 4 bars to 1/32; loading a sound never touches your patterns
- **Songs:** chain patterns A–D
- **Chord keys:** one finger plays an in-key chord (triads or sevenths of the scale, or fixed chord
  shapes), with voicings; on the keys, MIDI in, recording and the arpeggiator
- **Arpeggiator** with REPEAT and a beat LED, 16 scales with a white-key mode, glide,
  MONO / LEGATO / UNISON
- **Modulation matrix:** 4 slots per track, MIDI controllers as sources
- **Effects:** distortion and the SLICER per track; chorus, delay and reverb sends (the reverb as
  ROOM or SPRING); master limiter
- **FX layer:** hold FX for repeat, reverse, filter sweeps, tape stop, freeze and a harmonizer
  (OCT UP / OCT DN with shimmer), and mutes on the black keys; MENU > FX LATCH makes them toggle, so
  nothing has to stay held
- **Quick layers:** hold FX, GLO, SCL or EDIT for shortcuts on the keys and knobs, or double-tap it to
  keep the layer open; one-step undo (SAVE held); REC on every page; OCT+ confirms, OCT- goes back
- **Presets:** factory presets, 32 user preset slots and 4 projects, named on the device (an FM6
  sound keeps its own patch in both); projects from every earlier version load
- **Screen:** flat UI with Inter Tight and Fukiai icons, FLAT or LINE style, 10 palettes including
  grayscale, black and white, high contrast and NIGHT; tracks numbered 1–4 on small cushions;
  MENU > LARGE for tall knob cards with larger labels and values
- **LEDs:** idle buttons and keys glow dim so the panel can be found in the dark (MENU > LEDS: OFF,
  DIM LO, DIM HI or INV, the official firmware's look); PLAY turns green while playing; the keys show
  the notes the sequencer and MIDI IN play
- **USB:** class-compliant MIDI in and out, and a 44.1 kHz stereo audio input ("Felucca") that
  records the master output on the computer, no driver needed (at a fixed level with MENU > USB LEVEL FIXED;
  on macOS 13–15, set MENU > USB SERIAL to OFF so the audio input appears)
- **MIDI:** USB and TRS MIDI in; with ROUT CH1-4, channels 1–4 play tracks 1–4 and 5–16 are ignored
  (ROUT SEL: every channel plays the selected track), and the keys send on the track's channel; pitch
  bend, sustain, panic; clock from internal, USB or TRS
- **Web:** editor for every parameter (with a 6-operator FM patch editor), step grid, mixer,
  preset library, sample upload and recording with trim; full backup and restore; return to the
  official firmware

## Controls

![FM-1 controls with Felucca](docs/controls.jpg)

- Tap a page button for its page, again for the next; HOME returns home
- Hold FX, GLO, SCL or EDIT for its quick layer; hold SAVE to undo, HOME for the menu, SEQ for the song
- Double-tap FX, GLO, SCL or EDIT to keep its layer open without holding; tap it again to close
- On action pages, in dialogs and the menu, OCT+ does it and OCT− goes back
- Save a sound: stop, tap SAVE, pick a slot with KNOB 1, then OCT+ and OCT+ again (name it with the keys)

## Menu

Hold **HOME** for the menu. PRESETS moves through the rows, KNOB 1 or OCT+ changes the value, hold HOME
again to leave. Every new setting defaults to the earlier behaviour.

- **COLOR:** the palette. GREY (grayscale, called MONO up to 1.0.1), GREEN, AMBER, ICE, VIOLET, ROSE,
  PAPER (light), HI-CON (high contrast), NIGHT (the 0.9 look: true black, green-tinted text) and MONO
  (black and white)
- **STYLE:** FLAT (filled cards) or LINE (areas divided by thin lines)
- **LARGE:** OFF or ON: on HOME and the value pages the four knob cards grow tall, marked K1–K4, with
  larger labels and values about twice the size; the graph below becomes a strip. Lists, the piano roll,
  the drum grid and the quick layers keep their layout with larger labels
- **ANIM:** ON or OFF; OFF shows every change at once, without rolling digits or a gliding piano roll
- **LEDS:** OFF (no glow), DIM LO, DIM HI (default) or INV (the idle LEDs lit, the active ones dark)
- **HOLD:** how long FX, GLO, SCL or EDIT is held before its map shows
- **KNOB ACCEL:** OFF (one step per click) or ON: a fast, steady turn of a wide value moves 2 to 4 steps
  per click; lists never jump
- **FX LATCH:** ON, FX + an effect key turns the effect on until pressed again, the knob macros stay
  where you leave them, and FX + OCT− turns everything off
- **BPM LOCK:** ON, SELECT no longer changes the tempo; hold GLO and turn SELECT, tap F4 in the GLO
  layer or use GLO > GLOBAL instead
- **SPEAKER EQ:** FLAT, LOWCUT or BASS+, a tone setting for the built-in speaker (not a switch). It also
  shapes the headphone out and USB audio, so keep it on FLAT when recording. The firmware cannot turn
  the speaker off, but headphones in the jack do
- **USB LEVEL:** MASTER (the MASTER knob sets the USB audio level too) or FIXED (USB always at full
  level, MASTER sets only the speaker and headphones)
- **USB SERIAL:** ON or OFF, applied when the menu closes (the FM-1 reconnects). OFF leaves out the
  serial console, a developer tool, so the FM-1 is a plain audio + MIDI device; this lets macOS 13–15
  see its USB audio input. MIDI, the editor and the installer work either way
- **HARDWARE CALIBRATION** and **ABOUT**

## Engines

In the order the device lists them:

- **ANALOG**: virtual analog; two oscillators, noise, drive, resonant low-pass filter
- **FM6**: classic 6-operator FM (Dexed-based): 32 algorithms, a full patch per track edited in the
  web editor (which imports .syx files), macros on the device, an algorithm chart on screen; SLOT
  picks a factory patch (F1–F8) or the track's own (OWN)
- **PHASE**: phase distortion (ported from CrispyZebra)
- **LOFI**: chiptune; pulse, triangle, saw, noise and a 4-bit wave RAM, stepped envelope, sweep, arpeggio
- **SAMPLE**: multisampled instruments and 3 user sample slots
- **VOICE**: formant oscillator, sung vowels
- **TRIO**: 3 oscillators with ring modulation and sync, multimode filter
- **WHEEL**: tonewheel-style organ; drawbar registrations, percussion, key click, drive, rotary speaker
- **GRAIN**: granular textures from the built-in samples or a user slot
- **PHYS**: physical models: modal resonators, strings, struck membranes, sympathetic strings
- **NOISE**: noise from analog to digital: colours, crackle, shift-register and metallic tones
- **SLICE**: a drum break or your own sample cut into slices, one per key; set the slices by hand
  on the SLICES page
- **DRUM**: an 8-lane kit of Felucca's own drum voices on the General MIDI key map

The DIGITAL engine of 0.9 has been replaced by FM6: projects and presets with DIGITAL sounds load
as FM6 sounds converted from them. The SAMPLE engine's PERC kit was removed in 1.0.2: sounds and
projects that used it load as the DRUM engine's kit, on the same key map. FM6's patch bank (the B
slots) was removed in 1.0.3: user presets keep their own FM6 patch, and presets that used a B slot get
that patch on the first start of 1.0.3.

**SLICER** (FX page, every track): a tempo-synced 16-step gate or stutter, with 16 patterns.

## Scale keyboard

On the **SCL** page, set **QNT** to WHITE to play the selected scale using only the
white keys (SNAP keeps every key and rounds it down to the scale). C4 plays **ROOT**; consecutive white keys play consecutive scale notes
above and below it. Black keys are silent, including during live recording and
step entry. **TRN** transposes the resulting notes; the octave buttons shift them
by full octaves. Set QNT to OFF for the normal chromatic keyboard. QNT SEQ snaps the keys like SNAP and
also maps the sequenced notes onto the current ROOT / SCALE as they play (the steps are not changed; drum
kits are never quantized).

Available scales: chromatic (CHR), major (MAJ), natural minor (MIN), Dorian (DOR),
Mixolydian (MIX), major pentatonic (PEN), minor pentatonic (MPEN), harmonic minor
(HARM), Phrygian (PHRY), Lydian (LYD), Locrian (LOC), ascending melodic minor (MEL),
minor blues (BLUES), whole tone (WHOLE), half-whole diminished (DIMHW), and
whole-half diminished (DIMWH). Scales with other than seven notes continue across
the white keys without repeating notes; their roots need not fall on every C key.
Drum kits and incoming MIDI keep their own note mapping.

Press **SCL** again for the **CHORD** page: CHRD picks the chord keys (OFF, the scale's triads or
sevenths, or a fixed shape) and VOIC the voicing.

## If the FM-1 does not start

If an update is interrupted and the FM-1 stays black, check whether a computer sees it as a USB device named
**WL80UBOOT** (or a USB mass-storage device with ID 4C4A:8057). That is the chip's built-in boot mode, and
the FM-1 can be brought back:

- First try another USB data cable, and close every other app that uses MIDI, then run the web installer again.
- If it stays in boot mode, [FM-1 Transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter) reads and
  writes the FM-1's flash from a Mac through a Seeed XIAO RP2040 (three wires to the FM-1's USB lines). Back up
  the flash first, then write the official firmware (M-VAVE's FM-1.fwsc).
